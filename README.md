# SEC Filing Events Tracker: Implementation Summary

I've created a comprehensive system to track and visualize important events from SEC filings. Here's what I've implemented:

## Core Components

1. **SEC EDGAR API Client**
   - Connects to SEC's EDGAR database with proper rate limiting
   - Searches for specific filing types and retrieves content
   - Maps between CIK numbers and ticker symbols

2. **Specialized Filing Parsers**
   - Form 8-K parser for corporate events and changes
   - Form 4 parser for insider trading
   - Schedule 13D/G parser for institutional ownership
   - Form 10-Q/K parser for quarterly/annual reports
   - Form 14A/C parser for proxy statements

3. **Event Extraction Engine**
   - Uses natural language processing to identify key information
   - Extracts dates, amounts, and other structured data
   - Classifies events into specific categories

4. **Database Layer**
   - Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL for efficient data storage
   - Schema designed for events, companies, watchlists, and alerts
   - Optimized queries for calendar and filtering

5. **Next.js Frontend**
   - Calendar view for visualizing upcoming events
   - Table view for detailed information
   - Company search and filtering capabilities
   - Mobile-responsive design with TailwindCSS

6. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT-based authentication middleware
   - User-specific watchlists and alerts
   - Role-based access control

7. **Automation Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions for daily filing retrieval
   - Automated event extraction and classification
   - Status updates for pending events

## Key Features

- **Calendar Visualization**: Track corporate events in an intuitive calendar interface
- **Event Classification**: Automatically identifies 12+ types of significant events
- **Filtering & Search**: Find events by company, type, date range
- **Watchlists**: Track specific companies of interest
- **Alerts**: Get notified of new events matching your criteria
- **Persistence**: Maintains state between sessions

## Technical Highlights

- **Modular Architecture**: Each component is self-contained for easy maintenance
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout for robust code
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and error recovery
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects SEC's API usage guidelines
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle thousands of filings daily
- **Testing**: Jest framework for unit and integration tests

## Deployment Strategy

- **Vercel Hosting**: Seamless deployment of the Next.js application
- **GitHub Actions**: Scheduled tasks for continuous data updates
- **Database**: External PostgreSQL for data persistence
- **Monitoring**: Winston logging for application health

The system provides a complete solution for tracking important SEC filing events with a clean, modern interface that will help users stay informed about significant corporate actions.
